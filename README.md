# Installation and Usage

## Installation of the Connector with checkout.com payment functionality

Ensure that the version of SAP Commerce is supported for the plugin. Please view the Release Compatibility section for the current list of supported versions.

The Connector contains several extensions. Follow the following steps to include the Connector into your SAP Commerce application:

1. Unzip the supplied plugin zip file

2. Copy the extracted folders to the ${HYBRIS_BIN_DIR} of your SAP Commerce installation.

3. Run the ```ant clean``` command from within your bin/platform directory.

5. Copy the following lines into your localextensions.xml after <path dir="${HYBRIS_BIN_DIR}"/>. The extensions do not rely on any absolute paths so it is also possible to place the extensions in a different location (such as ${HYBRIS_BIN_DIR}/custom).
Run the command ```<path autoload="true" dir="${HYBRIS_BIN_DIR}/modules/checkoutcom"/>```

6. Run the commands below to install specific add-ons of the yaccelatorstorefront (replace "yacceleratorstorefront" with your custom storefront if relevant)

### Add-ons:
- B2C Accelerator: ```ant addoninstall -Daddonnames="checkoutaddon" -DaddonStorefront.yacceleratorstorefront="yacceleratorstorefront"```

### Optional

1. The checkoutsampledataaddon is optional, and can be installed by running the command:
```ant addoninstall -Daddonnames="checkoutsampledataaddon" -DaddonStorefront.yacceleratorstorefront="yacceleratorstorefront"```

2. Run the ```ant clean all``` command from within your bin/platform directory.

3. Run ```hybrisserver.sh``` to startup the SAP Commerce server.

4. Update your running system.using ```ant updatesystem```

Except for setting up your hosts file, the Checkout.com Connector will work initially without any external setup needed.

The add-ons are independent and can be installed on separate server instances.

## Installing the Connector using recipes

The Connector ships with gradle recipes to be used with the SAP Commerce installer:

B2C: b2c_acc_plus_checkout_com with b2c and checkout.com functionality. The recipe is based on the b2b_acc_plus recipes.

Recipes can be found under the installer folder. To use recipes on a clean installation, copy the folder hybris to your ${HYBRIS_BIN_DIR}

For local installations, the recipe generates a local.properties file with the properties defined in the recipe. You can optionally add your local.properties to the customconfig folder.

For cloud installations, generate a manifest.json that reflects different properties files per environment and aspect, languages packs and add-ons.

Install the Connector using recipes. Run the following commands:
- Create a solution from the accelerator templates and install the addons.
```HYBRIS_HOME/installer$ ./install.sh -r [RECIPE_NAME] setup```
- Build and initialize the platform
```HYBRIS_HOME/installer$ ./install.sh -r [RECIPE_NAME] initialize```
- Start a commerce suite instance
```HYBRIS_HOME/installer$ ./install.sh -r [RECIPE_NAME] start```
